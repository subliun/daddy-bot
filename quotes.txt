{"New Years Eve 2014, I was having a really rough night. It's hard to explain, but it got to the point where I walked up Jacob's Ladder and just sat at the top on a bench, crying. I was determined to be upset, but then you came running up the stairs and just said 'Happy New Year, buddy.' I don't know what it was, but something in the happiness of how you said it without pointing out my tears or making a scene really cheered me up for the rest of the night, and the rest of camp. So I just wanted to say thanks, and Happy New Year."} - Jachin Mee
